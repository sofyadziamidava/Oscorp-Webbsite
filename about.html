                <p>
                    The corporation is based out of the Oscorp Tower in New York. It was created and run by its CEO Norman Osborn. 
                    Norman studied chemistry and electrical engineering in college. He also took a number of courses in business administration. 
                    Norman Osborn's teacher, Professor Mendel Stromm, formed the business partnership. Since Norman put up the bulk of the financing,
                    they called their company the Osborn Corporation, or Oscorp.
